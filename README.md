# Contributing to Open Source Projects - A Beginner's Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the world of open source! If you're new to contributing to open source projects, you've come to the right place. This guide will walk you through the process of contributing to an open source HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website. We want to encourage you to share your knowledge, ideas, and creativity with the open source community.

## What is Open Source?

Open source refers to software or projects whose source code is made available to the public, allowing anyone to view, use, modify, and distribute the code. This collaborative approach fosters a vibrant community of developers working together to improve and create amazing projects.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Find an Open Source Project

To get started, find an open source project that aligns with your interests and skills. Look for projects that welcome beginner contributions and have clear guidelines for newcomers.

### Step 2: Understand the Project

Take some time to understand the project's purpose, goals, and existing codebase. Read the project's documentation and get familiar with its structure.

### Step 3: Set Up Your Development Environment

Follow the project's instructions to set up your development environment. This may involve installing Git, Node.js, and other dependencies.

### Step 4: Create a GitHub Account

Many open-source projects use the collaborative power of GitHub. If you want to contribute to these projects you need to set up a GitHub account at [GitHub](www.github.com) Choose your username carefully, as that would be your "band" in the open-source community.

### Step 5: Downloading the source code
For this site follow these steps to start contributing:

- Create a [GitHub](www.github.com) account 
- [Fork](https://github.com/cloudnative-nz/site) this repo 
- Run `git clone https://github.com/<yourusername>/site.git` in your command line to pull down the forked repo to your device 
- Run this website by opening the index.html file from your file explorer
- View the issues and decide on which one to work through, ask questions or ask for assistance in the thread of the issue if you need to.


### Step 6: Submit a Pull Request

When your changes are ready, submit a pull request to the original project repository. A pull request is a request to merge your changes into the main codebase. Be sure to follow the project's contribution guidelines and provide a clear description of your changes.

### Step 7: Engage with the Community

Engage with the community by participating in discussions, commenting on issues, and helping other contributors. Collaboration is a key aspect of open source, and being an active community member enhances your open source experience.

## Adding New Content

### Step 9: Create New Pages or Sections

Do you have ideas for new sections or pages for the website? Whether it's a new tutorial, a glossary, or an FAQ section, you can propose these additions to the project maintainers. Open an issue on the repository to discuss your ideas and get feedback from the community.

### Step 10: Implement Your Changes

If your ideas are well-received, implement the changes by adding new pages or sections to the website. Follow the project's code and style guidelines to ensure consistency.

### Step 11: Submit Another Pull Request

Once your changes are ready, submit another pull request with the new content. Remember to document your additions and explain their purpose in the pull request description, aswell as link you issue to the pull request to help everyone keep track of the work.

## Conclusion

Contributing to open source projects is a rewarding experience that allows you to learn, collaborate, and make a positive impact on the developer community. By adding your blog posts and new content, you're not only sharing your knowledge but also helping others learn and grow.

We hope this guide has inspired you to get involved in open source and start making meaningful contributions to the project. Happy coding!
